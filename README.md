# Carb Count

CarbCount is a useful carbohydrate calculator aimed mainly at diabetic people. Users can create their own meal by
 selecting products from a product list that they have previously added to the database.

Based on the nutritional information of each product, program calculates the required amount of insulin that needs to
 be taken in order to overcome glucose spike caused by the eaten meal.

The application is also useful for healthy people as they can find out the total number of calories they are about to
 consume.
